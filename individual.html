This involved delving into the research on factors that contribute to low physical activity levels. We explored various avenues, including the potential of using elements of gamification, social interaction, and personalized feedback to address common barriers like lack of motivation, time constraints, and perceived lack of enjoyment. Through this process, we aimed to pinpoint the most effective trigger, one that would not only initiate the laser maze experience but also resonate with users and encourage them to actively participate.</p>

                                    <br><h3 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">Vision statement 🔭</h3><br>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">Our research indicates a critical need for technology that tackles the growing issues of physical inactivity and social isolation among adolescents (12-18 years old). Studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1] reveal a concerning decline in physical activity among this age group, leading to increased health risks. Furthermore, a recent Pew Research Center report [2] highlights the rise of social media use and its potential to contribute to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.</p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">By leveraging these insights, we envision technology that bridges the gap between physical exercise and social interaction. This technology will create a fun and engaging environment where adolescents can be physically active while simultaneously fostering social connections with their peers. Through innovative features and gamification elements, we aim to motivate teenagers to embrace a healthy lifestyle and build meaningful social bonds.</p>

                                    <br><h3 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">Problem statement 📝</h3><br>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">The current landscape for teenagers presents a concerning trend: a decline in physical activity coupled with a rise in social media use that can contribute to feelings of isolation.  This lack of physical engagement and meaningful social interaction can negatively impact their overall well-being.</p>
                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">Existing solutions often fall short. Traditional fitness routines can be monotonous and lack social engagement, while social media platforms, while fostering connection, often do little to encourage physical activity. This dichotomy necessitates a novel approach.</p>
                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">There is a clear need for technology that effectively addresses this dual challenge.  We propose developing a solution that motivates teenagers to be physically active, while simultaneously fostering meaningful social connections with their peers. This technology will bridge the gap between physical exercise and social interaction, promoting a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle for adolescents.</p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">We continue with our Inspiration board by reigniting the creative spark. Each team member will brainstorm and contribute two initial concepts that leverage technology to get teenagers moving and socializing more. These ideas will then be passed around the table, allowing each member to build upon them, refine them, and suggest additional features. Through this collaborative brainstorming process, we aim to transform these initial sparks into a robust concept boasting a rich tapestry of features designed to tackle the challenge of adolescent physical inactivity and social isolation.</p>
                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s"><a href="./images/client/Cooperation Contract Group 2.pdf" target="_blank">Document.</a></p>
                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">My initial idea is creating a technology that attaches to a Fietskar, transforming any bike into an exercise bike. This would enable teenagers to compete together and exercise more, even if they're physically distant. Imagine a mobile app that connects riders and allows them to see each other's progress on a virtual track. We could even incorporate leaderboards and challenges to add a layer of friendly competition and keep teenagers motivated.</p>
                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">I have received a lot of feedback and suggestions from my teammates that have really enriched this initial concept. For example, Tijmen suggested adding augmented reality elements to the virtual track, creating a more immersive experience for riders.  Rik proposed incorporating social features like voice chat, allowing teenagers to connect and motivate each other during their workouts. These insights have helped us envision a more comprehensive technology that not only encourages exercise but also fosters a strong sense of community among teenagers.</p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">After our discussion, we ultimately gravitated towards Pjotr's idea of utilizing a laser beam to create a collaborative maze game. This concept sparked excitement as it offered a unique way for teenagers to exercise and socialize simultaneously. We envisioned a laser maze course that could be set up in various locations, encouraging groups to work together to navigate the beams while strategizing and communicating effectively. This not only promotes physical activity but also hones teamwork and problem-solving skills in a fun and interactive environment.</p>

Level 2, the Container diagram, will decompose the laser maze system into its core components, such as the laser control unit, sensor system, and user interface. By establishing a clear software architecture through the C4 model, we can ensure a well-organized and maintainable codebase as we move forward with development.</p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">Recognizing the value of further feedback, we decided to take a proactive approach and gather additional insights from potential users in the Oud-woensel area.  To maximize efficiency, we split into two groups: myself, Tijmen, and Pjotr in one, and Elene and Rik in the other.  Prior to venturing out, we all committed to individual research on the target audience and collaboratively generated a list of insightful questions. This groundwork ensured we were well-prepared to engage with the community and gain valuable feedback that would further refine our laser maze project.</p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">In our initial prototype, we utilized grass cord to represent the laser beams within the maze. However, after seeking feedback from Mijke, we pivoted to a more aesthetically pleasing solution. Red string replaced the grass cord, instantly enhancing the visual appeal of the laser beams. To further improve the user experience, we incorporated a paper roof for the maze. This addressed the functionality of the tent enclosure from the 3D model, allowing the red string "laser beams" to be clearly visible even in outdoor settings.</p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">Reflecting on Sprint 1, I've gained a valuable understanding of the collaborative power of brainstorming and the importance of a well-defined project plan. Working alongside my team was incredibly enriching, and I learned how effectively diverse perspectives can fuel creative solutions. The project plan with CTPD provided much-needed structure and clarity, ensuring we were all aligned on goals and timelines.
                                          <br>However, there's always room for improvement. I think we could have been even more efficient in our brainstorming sessions by using specific techniques to focus our ideas. Additionally, the project plan could benefit from more detailed task breakdowns and deadlines for each team member.
