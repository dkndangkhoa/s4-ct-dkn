                                    <br>The Fietskar's versatility lies in its ability to be customized with various modules. This allows us to tailor the experience to different social goals, providing informative and engaging experiences that spark conversation and raise awareness.
                                          
                                    <br>As part of this project, we'll be tasked with designing, building, and testing interactive modules that address a chosen social issue. This hands-on experience will not only allow us to hone our creative and technical skills but also contribute to a meaningful project that has the potential to make a real difference in our communities.</p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">After a discussion about the project's direction, we hit upon a promising concept: could FietsKar be used to motivate people to exercise more, thereby contributing to better mental health outcomes? Numerous studies have shown a clear link between physical activity and improved mood, reduced stress, and better sleep, all of which are crucial for mental well-being. By gamifying exercise or incorporating social elements that promote a sense of community, FietsKar could potentially address a growing public health concern by making physical activity more engaging and accessible.</p>

                                          Integrating the valuable insights gleaned from the sketch and storyboard feedback, I'm now crafting a 3D model for the laser maze.  This digital representation will depict the entire experience,  including a tent enclosure. The tent serves a crucial purpose:  by creating a controlled environment, it allows the laser beams to be visible outdoors during daylight hours. This attention to detail ensures the laser maze can be enjoyed in a wider range of settings, enhancing its overall usability.</p>

Level 1, the System Context diagram, will provide a high-level overview of the project, showcasing how it interacts with external systems and users. Level 2, the Container diagram, will decompose the laser maze system into its core components, such as the laser control unit, sensor system, and user interface. By establishing a clear software architecture through the C4 model, we can ensure a well-organized and maintainable codebase as we move forward with development.</p>

However, after seeking feedback from Mijke, we pivoted to a more aesthetically pleasing solution. Red string replaced the grass cord, instantly enhancing the visual appeal of the laser beams. To further improve the user experience, we incorporated a paper roof for the maze. This addressed the functionality of the tent enclosure from the 3D model, allowing the red string "laser beams" to be clearly visible even in outdoor settings.</p>

                                          <br>Questions centered around enhancing user engagement. Could a treasure be hidden within the maze?  Perhaps a tangible reward for completion? Identifying the ideal target group and strategies to draw people outdoors were also key points of discussion.  The suggestion to leverage social media to generate excitement resonated strongly, prompting us to consider how to best utilize these platforms to motivate participation. Integrating a game element was another intriguing suggestion, potentially connecting the maze to a larger experience.
                                          <br>The feedback itself provided a treasure trove of ideas.  The ice cream sound effect, for instance, offered a creative way to entice teenagers outdoors.  The concept of a city-wide trigger that activates the maze introduced an element of surprise and intrigue.  Partnering with a school or sports teacher was another valuable suggestion, allowing us to tailor the maze's difficulty to specific age groups and physical capabilities.  Several comments highlighted the importance of fostering a sense of playfulness and rekindling childhood wonder.  Feedback also touched on the possibility of incorporating a communication disruption element, perhaps linked to social media, to further engage the target audience.  The importance of narrative and connecting with the target group's interests was emphasized.

This will also allow me to dedicate more consistent effort towards building my portfolio.  Showcasing my work regularly is important for growth, and I want to make sure my portfolio reflects the ongoing learning and development I'm experiencing.
